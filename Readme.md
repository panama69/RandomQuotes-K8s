This is a sample application deploy to Kubernetes.  It's a good first application as it has no other components, but has an environment variable you can use to practice secrets on.

The docker image is built using a GitHub action and it is pushed to Docker Hub.  You can find the docker repository here: https://hub.docker.com/r/octopussamples/randomquotes-k8s/tags

# Prep Work

The docker image, manifest files, and variables will be provided to you.  You need to provide a k8s cluster, octopus instance, and worker.

**You MUST finish all the prep work prior to RKO.  We will not wait for you to install K8s, configure a worker, or update your hosts file.**

## 1. Install K8s
Install ONE of the following on a VM or locally!

- [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) - easiest and preferred
  - 🍎 If you are working on a Mac with an Apple chip—Docker Desktop is the easiest option:
    - Run [`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/#system-requirements)
    - Enable [Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/#install-and-turn-on-kubernetes)
    - Confirm `Use Virtualization framework` is enabled in Docker Desktop → General → Settings
- [rancher desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation) -> please note you will not have to install docker for this to work.
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

## 2. Configure K8s
Open up a command prompt or terminal.  Change the current directory in the terminal to the `k8s/provision` folder in this repo.
- Run the following commands:
    - Create all the namespaces: `kubectl apply -f namespaces.yaml`
    - Create the service account for deployments: `kubectl apply -f service-account-and-token.yaml`
    - To get the token value run: `kubectl describe secret octopus-svc-account-token`.  Copy the token to a file for future usage.
    - Install the NGINX Ingress Controller: `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.9.5/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml`
    - If you are running rancher desktop or minikube
        - Run `kubectl describe service kubernetes`.  Copy the endpoint, for example `172.18.135.254:6443` for later.

## 3. Pre-Configure Octopus
Using your cloud instance of choice do the following:

- Create a worker pool name "Local K8s Worker Pool".
- Ensure you have the following environments: "Development", "Test", "Staging", "Production"
- Install a tentacle to connect to Octopus Deploy
    - Option A: Install a polling tentacle directly on your machine (preferred and easiest).
    - Option B: Run the tentacle as a docker container.  Run `docker run --env ServerApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY --env ServerUrl=YOUR_SERVER_URL --env Space=Default --env TargetWorkerPool="Local K8s Worker Pool" --env ACCEPT_EULA=Y --env DISABLE_DIND=N --env ServerPort=10943 --env TargetName="Docker Worker" --platform linux/amd64 --privileged octopusdeploy/tentacle:8.1.563` 
    - Option C: Run the tentacle from Kubernetes.  
        - In a file explorer, go to `octopus-tentacle.yaml` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SERVER_URL` with your API key and server URL.
        - Run `kubectl apply -f octopus-tentacle.yaml`
    - WAIT until the worker shows up as healthy in your Local K8s Worker Pool.
- Go to Library -> Feeds
    - Add a docker hub feed
    - Provide your username and PAT or a service account username and PAT otherwise you won't be able to create releases.
- Go to Infrastructure -> Accounts. Add the token from the earlier step.
- Go to Infrastructure -> Targets.  Add the kubernetes cluster.  
    - If you are using docker desktop it should be: `https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/`
    - If you are running rancher desktop or minikube:
        - Use the endpoint IP address from earlier. For example `https://172.18.135.254:6443`
    - Ensure the checkbox `Skip TLS Verification` is checked to make things easier.
    - Use the token account you created from earlier.
    - Use the Local K8s Worker Pool from earlier.
    - Assign it to all four environments from earlier.
    - Use the role `local-k8s`.
    - **If you are running the tentacle in a container**
        - Update the health check to use an execution container.  For the image use `octopuslabs/k8s-workertools:1.29.0`
- Go to Library -> Git Credentials.
    - Add a new GitHub PAT token for your user.  
        - The PAT will need explict access to OctopusSamples.  
        - Create a fine-grained key
        - Set the resource owner to OctopusSamples
        - Select Public Repositories (read-only) as the option.
    - Username will be your username.

## 4. Configure your hosts file.
Go to your hosts file (if on Windows) and add the following entries.  The nginx ingress controller uses host headers for all routing.  Doing this will allow you to easily access the application running on your k8s cluster.

```
127.0.0.1       randomquotes.local
127.0.0.1       randomquotesdev.local
127.0.0.1       randomquotestest.local
127.0.0.1       randomquotesstaging.local
127.0.0.1       randomquotesprod.local
```

## 5. Install Argo

- Install ArgoCD
    - Run `kubectl create namespace argocd`
    - Run `kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml`
- To access ArgoCD UI
    - Run `kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443`
    - **Important** The port forwarding will only work while that window is open.
    - If you want to, you can mess with ingress rules, but this is the quick and dirty approach to getting going.
    - To login
        - Username is admin
        - Run `kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' --namespace argocd` to get the password

# 200 Session at RKO

All the activities below will be done at RKO.

## 1. First Activity - Basic Deployment 

In the first activity we will do a standard manifest file deployment to the default namespace in kubernetes using `kubectl apply`.

The goal of this activity is to expose you to a simple manifest file and what the experience is like for a bare-bones, no automation experience.

These instructions will deploy the following to the default namespace.  

- Secret
- Deployment (Image)
- ClusterIp Service
- Ingress Rule

To perform the deployment do the following:
- Go to https://hub.docker.com/r/octopussamples/randomquotes-k8s/tags and find the latest version tag (0.1.3 for example).  Update the `image` entry in the randomquotes-deployment.yaml file.
- Open up a command prompt or terminal.  Change the current directory in the terminal to the `k8s/base` folder in this repo. 
- Run `kubectl apply -f randomquotes-secrets.yaml`
- Run `kubectl apply -f randomquotes-deployment.yaml`

It might take a moment for the deployment to finish.  I like to check the status of the pods.  Run `kubectl get pods` until the randomquotes pod shows up as healthy.

Once the deployment is finished go to http://randomquotes.local.

## 2. Second Activity - Leveraging Kustomize

In the second activity we will deploy to each of the environment namespaces using kustomize and overlays.

In the previous activity we deployed to the default namespace.  In the real-world, we'd want to do some environmental progression and testing before pushing up to production.  Rather than have a manifest file per environment, we will have a kustomize overlay per environment.  The following items are changed with each kustomize file:

- The image version
- The secret value
- The ingress rule

If we were using ArgoCD or some other similar tool we could use these kustomize overlays with no additional configuration changes.  

We are going to deploy to all four namespaces.  The instructions are the same, so repeat the following for each environment.

- Go to https://hub.docker.com/r/octopussamples/randomquotes-k8s/tags and find the latest version tag (0.1.3 for example).  Go to k8s/overlays/[environment]/kustomization.yaml file.  Update the newtag entry with the latest version.
- Open up a command prompt or terminal.  Change the current directory in the terminal to the `k8s/overlays/[environment]/` folder in this repo. 
- Run `kubectl apply -k ./`
- To check the pods run `kubectl get pods -n [environment namespace name]`
- Once the deployment is over go to http://randomquotes[environment name].local
- Assuming everything is working, repeat the following steps for each environment.

## 3. Third Activity - Using Octopus Deploy

In the third activity we will configure Octopus Deploy to deploy our application to k8s using the manifest files.

In this example, we will put the kustomize overlays aside and instead use Octopus' raw yaml steps + structured variable configuration.
